# Lockboxes

Checks if the list of boxes can all be unlcoked.

    Each box is numbered sequentially from 0 to n - 1 and each box
    may contain keys to the other boxes. A key with the same number
    as a box opens that box.

    All keys are assumed to be positive integers.
    There can be keys that do not have boxes.
    The first box <boxes[0]> is assumed to be unlocked.
