# Island Perimeter

This problem challenge involves finding the perimeter of an island described as a 2D grid.
This 2 Dimesional grid/matrix consists of 0s and 1s, with 0 and 1 representing the sea
and land respectively.

`grid` is a list of list of integers:

- Each element, is a square with seide length 1.
- Cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally).
- `grid` is rectangular, with its width and height not exceeding 100

The grid is completely surrounded by water
There is only one island (or nothing).
The island doesn’t have “lakes” (water inside that isn’t connected to the water surrounding the island).
