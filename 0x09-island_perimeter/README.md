# Island Perimeter

Finds the perimeter of the island on a given 2 Dimensional grid.

These conditions are applied to the function:

- grid is a list of list of integers that:
  - 0 represents the water
  - 1 represents land
  - Each cell is square, with a side length of 1
  - Cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally).
  - grid is rectangular, with its width and height not exceeding 100
- The grid is completely surrounded by water
- There is only one island (or nothing).
- The island doesn’t have “lakes” (water inside that isn’t connected to the water surrounding the island).

When on a cell, we look at all 4 linear directions and try to spot a 1 as there is likely to be less ones in most scenarios.

### Example

```
island_perimeter = __import__('0-island_perimeter').island_perimeter

if __name__ == "__main__":
    grid = [
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    ]
    print(island_perimeter(grid))
```

outputs: `12`
